# Collections

Collections are set of structs that contain data in a specified order.\
The library also contains auxiliary routines that relate to data allocation and data access.\
Here the list of all classes:

## Memory

* **[Allocators](allocator/allocator.md)** - allocation and freeing memory blocks;

## Containers

* **[Vector](vector/vector.md)** - a container in which elements are stored contiguously;
* **[Tree Set](tree_set/tree_set.md)** - a set of unique items, based on binary balanced tree;

## Data access

* **[Iterator](iterator/iterator.md)** - the interface for sequentially accessing items in a collection.
